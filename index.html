            “Should I start my own publishing company?” is one of the most oft-asked questions of self-published authors. Contrary to popular belief, not all publishing companies are like the Penguin Random Houses of the world (or, as I like to call them, Random Penguin). In fact, there are hundreds of small presses out there—just take a look at our Indie Groundbreaking Publisher column! Some authors create publishing companies just to publish their own books; others go on to publish the works of others too.
